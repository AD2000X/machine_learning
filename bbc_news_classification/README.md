## 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

### Data Source:
- BBC News dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- A pre-classified and text-processed version of the dataset suited for learning objectives.

### Data Cleaning Techniques:
- **pandas**: Loading and manipulating datasets.
- **re**: Removing HTML tags, URLs, email addresses, extra line breaks, and whitespace.
- Deduplication and missing value handling: Identifying and removing duplicate rows and handling missing data.
- **drive.mount** and **os.chdir**: Setting up Google Drive mounts and directory paths.
- Handling and checking duplicate columns.

### Process:
1. Load the dataset, inspect its structure (row/column count, category distribution).
2. Clean data to ensure it is suitable for downstream processing.
3. Visualize category distribution using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Linguistic Analysis

### Statistical Analysis:
- Category distribution analysis.
- Text length statistics and distribution.

### Syntactic Features Analysis:
- **Part-of-speech tagging (POS Tagging)**: Extracting POS tags using **nltk.pos_tag**, visualized through heatmaps.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Using **spacy** to extract named entity types (e.g., PERSON, ORG) and analyzing distributions by category.

### Semantic Analysis:
- **Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob**: Measuring polarity and subjectivity.
- **Emotion Detection with NRCLex**: Comparing emotional trends across categories with line charts.
- **Keyword visualization with WordCloud**.

### Special Feature Analysis:
- **datefinder**: Extracting temporal information from text.
- Geospatial recognition through NER categories **GPE** (geo-political entities), **LOC** (locations), and **FAC** (facilities), visualized with location-based word clouds.
- **textstat**: Computing text readability metrics.

### Process:
1. Analyze category distribution and text length.
2. Extract syntactic, semantic, and special features.
3. Visualize each category's text features using word clouds, violin plots, and distribution charts.

## 3. Feature Engineering

### Text Vectorization:
- **CountVectorizer**: Generating term frequency vectors.
- **BERT**: Using pre-trained models to generate contextual embeddings and leveraging **PyTorch** for batch processing and padding.
- Managing sequence padding and truncation with **attention_mask**.

### Dimensionality Reduction:
- **UMAP**: Compressing high-dimensional features and adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., `n_neighbors`, `min_dist`).
- **t-SNE**: Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D, highlighting the aggregation of text features.

### Normalization and Encoding:
- **StandardScaler**: Standardizing numerical features.
- **LabelEncoder**: Converting categories to integers.
- **OneHotEncoder**: Converting categories to sparse binary vectors.

### Process:
1. Extract contextual embeddings with **BERT** and apply dimensionality reduction (**UMAP**).
2. Process large datasets efficiently using batch mechanisms (**batch_encode**, `batch_size=10`).
3. Transform categories into integer labels or one-hot encodings for different model designs.
